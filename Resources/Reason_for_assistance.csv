Notes,,,,,,
"1.   A record of all reasons a client has presented to any specialist homelessness agency during the reporting year. The number of reasons  is greater than the number of clients because a client can specify multiple reasons for
     seeking assistance. However each individual reason is counted only once per client across support periods.",,,,,,
2.  The reason group is a count of unique clients within all categories in the group; therefore it is not the sum of the components.,,,,,,
"3.  Percentages have been calculated using total number of clients as the denominator (less not stated): Aust 287,517, NSW 69,248, Vic 114,803, Qld 43,055, WA 24,924, SA 19,218, Tas 6,440, ACT 4,135, NT 9,042.",,,,,,
