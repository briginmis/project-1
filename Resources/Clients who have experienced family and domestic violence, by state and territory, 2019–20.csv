(a)  Clients may access services in more than one state or territory. Therefore the total will be less than the sum of jurisdictions.,,,,,,,,,,
"(b)  Rates are crude rates based on the Australian estimated resident population at 30 June of the reference year, as detailed in the online technical information.",,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,
"1.   A client is identified as experiencing family and domestic violence if in any support period during the reporting period:  
        •  the client was formally referred from a non-SHS FDV agency to an SHS agency, or
        • 'family and domestic violence' was reported as a reason they sought assistance, or  
        • during any support period they required family or domestic violence assistance.",,,,,,,,,,
"2.  For state/territory-specific data quality issues, refer to the Explanatory Notes.",,,,,,,,,,
"3.  From 2017-18 to 2018-19, there was a three per cent decrease in the total number of Victorian homelessness clients and a 10 percent decrease in family violence clients following years of steady increases in these numbers. The decrease was primarily due to a practice correction in how some family violence agencies were recording clients. In addition, during 2018-19, a phased process to shift family violence intake to non-SHS services began, which may result in an overall decrease in the number of SHS family violence clients over the coming years. Caution should be used when comparing Victorian client numbers over recent years.",,,,,,,,,,
"4.  Support period counts may differ from previous publications due to an improvement in methodology, which has resulted in a small decrease in the number of support periods.",,,,,,,,,,
